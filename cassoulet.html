  <h3>Description:</h3>
  <p>Cassoulet is a rich, slow-cooked casserole that originated in the Southwest region of France.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>White beans</li>
    <li>Pork sausage</li>
    <li>Duck and/or goose meat</li>
    <li>Pork skin</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Duck confit</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Thyme</li>
    <li>Bay leaves</li>
    <li>Peppercorn</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Soak the beans overnight in a large dish. Water should cover a few inches over the beans.</li>
    <li>The next day, use a large pot to cook the beans.</li>
    <li>Rinse the beans and pour them over. Add all the herbs and seasoning with the beans, and top everything with water. Cook on the stove, medium heat for approximately 1 hour or until done.</li>
    <li>Use a large roasting tray or pan for the sausage and meat. Season with salt and pepper, add some duck or goose fat, thyme, a couple of bay leaves, garlic, then place the tray in the preheated oven at 400 degrees to cook for about 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>After 15 minutes, remove the meats and save them for later. Add a bit of water to the tray; scrub gently with a spatula to detach the meat juice form the bottom of the tray.</li>
    <li>Pour the juice in the pan with the beans for extra flavor.</li>
    <li>Once the beans are cooked, discard the herbs. Cut all the meat in medium-sized pieces and palce them on a tray or plate.</li>
    <li>Use a casserole: put the meat first, then the beans. Cover everything with the juice, just enough to cover the beans.</li>
    <li>Place the casserole in a preheated oven at 400 degrees and leave it for approximately 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes, depending on the size. After 30 minutes, make sure to check and add some juice if necessary.</li>
    <li>Add the duck confit and cook for 15 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
